### Node
* Contains data and link to the next node
* Stored data as a single instance variable
* Links are represented by the references to nodes

### Head node
* The first node of a linked list
* Typically a variable is reserved to store the head node (The entry point)

### Linked list object
* Contains an instance variable **head**, but not instance variables for every node
* An empty linked list is set to null
* Thus, constructor should set **head** to null
