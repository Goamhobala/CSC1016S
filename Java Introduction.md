### Origin
* Originally created for home appliances in 1991

### Translation process
* A compiler language
* Before it's compiled into machine code for each processor, java code is first converted into java-byte code using the java virtual machine (jvm)
* Write-once, run everywhere

###  Objects and Methods
* Java is a high level object oriented programming (oop)
* Objects of the same type are said to have the same type, or belong to the same class
* All programming constructs in java are part of a class.

### Application programs 
* When a java application program (regular program) is run, the run-time environment automatically invokes the main method
* All application programs must have a main method
* Note that not every class must have a main method. Only the application program, namely the program that's executed first (like index.scss, e.g.)

```java
public class Hello{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println("Hi mom!");
	}
}
```
