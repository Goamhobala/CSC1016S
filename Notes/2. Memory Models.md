### Primitive types vs Object types:
* **Primitive**:
	* Basic, predefined data types containing simple, pure values of a type
	* There are 8 primitive types in java: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double.
	* Changes made to the value of a copy of a variable does not alter the value of the original variable
	* Primitive types are stored on the stack (A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out principle)
* **Object**
	* Examples: String, Array, Class, and other defined by the users. 
	* Also known as reference data type. They are passed by reference, i.e., the variables store a reference to the memory address to where the object is being stored in the **heap** (the area of memory used to store objects)
	* This means that changes made to any variable will be made to every other variable pointing to the same object.
### Drawing memory models for Primitive types
```java
int var1;
var1 = 57;
int var2;
var2 = var1;
var1 = 123;
System.out.println("Var1: " + var1 + "\nVar2: " + var2);
/* returns 
Var1: 123
Var2: 57 */
```
