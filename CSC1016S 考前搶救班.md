4. To avoid privacy leak, pass a deep copy of the object to the constructor, instead of the object itself.

5. An interface can extend another interface, but not implement another interface. e.g. List extends Collections
6. Primitive types, e.g. int, cannot be printed without being initialised (i.e. assigned an initial value, even if it's declared) 
7. The compareTo() method throws 1. NullPointerException if the argument is null 2. ClassCastException if two aren't comparable. (Since they must first be casted into the same type before they could be compared)
8.  array.length is equivalent to arrayList.size(). array\[i] is equivalent to arrayList.get(i);
9. Grid layout: Priorities rows over columns. To achieve the number of rows specified, give up columns specified 
10. you can have new String\[3]\[] but not new String\[]\[3]. This is because you can have an array of arrays of varying size. And the first bracket is always used to specified the size of the array. (rows times columns)
11. In borderLayout, CENTER can span across the entire row (occupied WEST and EAST), but NORTH and SOUTH cannot occupied the area of CENTER if CENTER is empty
