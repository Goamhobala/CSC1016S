These are my solutions for the assignments of CSC1016S back in 2023.
If you're here looking at this repo, that means you're probably stuck on one of your assignments :)
Feel free to take a look at the code as a reference for coming up with your own solutions (though you actually shouldn't be haha)
Just note that don't copy and paste the code as it is! There's a plagiarism detection mechanism built inside automarker,
plus it won't serve you any good if you want to become a competent programmer and get a job. (Or just not fail CSC2001F, just saying)
